# WP GraphQL Reading Time

Gives the post reading time in minutes as a GraphQL Field.

This is a very simple plugin I created for a demo while preparing for a talk.

You need to have already installed the [WPGraphQL](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql) plugin on your WordPress site in order for this to work.
